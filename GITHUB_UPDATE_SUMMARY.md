## 📝 Key Messages Communicated

### The Problem
"Player-connected and player-disconnected events were being sent to Takaro but NOT being stored in the database."

### The Root Cause
"For GENERIC game servers, Takaro IGNORES manually sent player events and instead auto-generates them by polling getPlayers and detecting changes."

### The Solution
"v1.7.1 removes the manual event sending and lets Takaro's polling system work correctly."

### The Result
"Player events now appear in Takaro dashboard, activity tracking works, and hooks/modules can respond to player events."
